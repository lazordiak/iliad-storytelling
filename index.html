    ILIAD 1-21<br>
<span id="pos0"></span>, Muse, the <span id="pos1"></span> rage of
<span id="pos2"></span> Achilles,<br>
<span id="pos3"></span> thing, which inflicted <span id="pos4"></span> upon the Greeks.<br>
Many <span id="pos5"></span> souls it sent spiraling down to Hades --<br>
<span id="pos6"></span>,<br>
-- and it left their bodies for the dogs.<br>
It all fell out as <span id="pos7"></span> Zeus planned it,<br>
from the very beginning, when<br>
Agamemnon -- <span id="pos8"></span> -- and
Achilles<br>
first split in disagreement,<br>
<span id="pos9"></span>.<br>
Who among the gods <span id="pos10"></span>?<br>
The son of Zeus and Leto, Apollo -- he was angry with Agamemnon,<br>
<span id="pos11"></span>,<br>
and sent <span id="pos12"></span> onto the Achaean army, and men were dying fast<br>
because Agamemnon had dishonored the priest Chryses,<br>
who had approached the <span id="pos13"></span> of the Greeks<br>
bearing a king's ransom so as to free his daughter,<br>
<span id="pos14"></span>,<br>
and holding as well the golden scepter of Apollo,<br>
topped with a supplicant's wreath.<br>
He <span id="pos15"></span> all the Greeks, but most of all the
two sons of Atreus,<br>
who were <span id="pos16"></span>: "Sons of Atreus,<br>
and all you other well-armored Greeks,<br>
<span id="pos17"></span>,<br>
may the Olympian gods grant to you the sack of Troy,<br>
Priam's city, and a safe journey home.<br>
but please free my dear child, and take this ransom,<br>
in honor of Zeus and the far-shooter Apollo".<br>
